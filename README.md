# DocuQuery-RAG: A Retrieval-Augmented Generation System for Enterprise Document Q&A
This project demonstrates how **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** can be applied to organizational knowledge management.
Employees or researchers can ask natural language questions, and the system retrieves relevant passages from company documents (PDFs, manuals, policies, reports) before generating a grounded answer with an LLM.
The framework is domain-agnostic and can be adapted for research labs, HR policies, financial reports, or technical manuals.

## Overview

Traditional LLMs rely solely on pre-trained knowledge, often hallucinating when asked about specific company or project data. **DocuQuery-RAG** solves this by integrating an intelligent retrieval pipeline that fetches relevant document chunks before generation.

## System Components

- **1Ô∏è‚É£ Document Embedding & Indexing**  
  - Uses `SentenceTransformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)` for text embeddings.  
  - Stores document vectors efficiently using **FAISS** for similarity search.

- **2Ô∏è‚É£ Retrieval & Re-Ranking**  
  - Retrieves top-k relevant passages for a user query.  
  - Optionally re-ranks them using a **CrossEncoder** for improved contextual precision.

- **3Ô∏è‚É£ LLM Response Generation (LLaMA)**  
  - Uses **Meta-LLaMA 3‚Äì8B** as the answering model.  
  - The system builds a structured prompt combining retrieved context + query.  

- **4Ô∏è‚É£ Output Formatting**  
  - Answers are generated in full sentences.  
  - Long outputs are neatly wrapped to maintain readability in Colab or console.

## üíª Running the Notebook

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.  
2. Mount Google Drive (if using external PDFs).  
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   !pip install faiss-cpu sentence-transformers transformers accelerate huggingface_hub

4. Run all cells in order to build the index and interact with the RAG system.
